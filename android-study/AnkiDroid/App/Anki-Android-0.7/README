=== Running with Ant ===

1. Create a "local.properties" file containing the path to the Android SDK, for instance:
sdk.dir=/home/nico/programs/android-sdk

2. Plug in your Android phone via USB and run the following command: ant install-device

3. To install on an emulator run: ant install-emulator

=== Zeemote JS1 support ===

The controller must be paired first.  Turn on Bluetooth, Go to Preferences -> Navigation and check "Zeemote support".  Restart AnkiDroid.  Start reviewing a deck and use the zeemote buttons to show answers and answer cards (A - Good, B - Fail, D - Easy).
